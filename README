GPolygon

A tiny imlementation of a steady state genetic algorithm (GA) which
evolves series of colored polygons to approximate a target image
(mimicking [1]).  The entire project is encoded in <300 LOC of Common
Lisp (CL).  This includes serving the main page and images using the
hunchentoot [2] CL webserver, and generating ~300LOC of HTML and
JavaScript through the cl-who [3] and Parenscript [4] libraries.

All processing is performed client-side in JavaScript.  Any image
served by a CORS-enabled [5] web server may be used as the target of
the GA.  The image is stored in a canvas element, and fitness
evaluation is performed in an accompanying canvas.  GA parameters may
be adjusted interactively during the course of a run.  Evolved polygon
images may be downloaded as JSON and shared between instances of the
application.

The resulting application is available at [6].
